Building My GitHub Pages Site: A Journey in Web Development
Creating my GitHub Pages site was a fascinating, hands-on experience—one filled with learning, troubleshooting, and refining ideas until everything clicked. What started as a simple concept evolved into a structured, well-designed platform showcasing my blog. Here’s how I built it, step by step.

At the beginning, I wanted a simple static website, and GitHub Pages seemed like the perfect free solution. I started with basic research—reading official documentation and experimenting with the default themes. While GitHub Pages offered easy hosting, I realized I needed Jekyll to add more customization and dynamic features.

After enabling Jekyll, I structured my site using Markdown files. I kept it simple at first, using an index.md file for the homepage and testing how Jekyll processed my content.

Once I got Markdown working, the next challenge was structuring the site. I created:

_layouts/default.html: A base layout that structured my entire site. It;s basicly slightly modified Jekyll modernist default file

_config.yml: This was critical—defining the theme, collections, and basic site settings.

Each file worked together to ensure my blog posts were properly listed, formatted, and displayed.



Final Thoughts: Lessons Learned
This journey taught me valuable lessons in structuring a site, using Markdown and Liquid templates, and balancing functionality with design.

I encountered challenges—from figuring out Jekyll collections to refining button layouts—but every mistake led to a new learning experience. Whether it's tweaking CSS for interactivity or optimizing blog structure, building a GitHub Pages site has been a rewarding step into web development.

If you're thinking about starting your own GitHub Pages site, just dive in! Experiment, tweak, and refine. The best way to learn is by building.
