It's been a while since my last post. During that time I was grinding and learning a lot. I mostly followed the **SOC L1** path on TryHackMe. I completed it in November 2025, along with prerequisite paths like Cybersecurity 101, but THM updated the SOC L1 rooms and the version I had finished was labeled legacy. So I spent November and December finishing the updated path and doing the **Advent of Cyber 2025** challenges. 

That was a lot of information, skills, tools, and techniques to absorb. I’ll try to look at it generally to put what I learned in order without going into too much detail. I’ll save the deep dives for later posts.

I also kept a **180** day learning streak on TryHackMe, which is more a motivational metric than a meaningful achievement, but it kept me going.

### SOC L1 path layout
Coursework consisted of 15 main chapters filled with different rooms:

* **Blue Team Introduction** - I started my defensive security journey by exploring the Blue Team and the Security Operations Centre (SOC). I learned why defensive security matters and how it protects organisations.

* **SOC Team Internals** - I practiced core SOC analyst skills to triage, classify, and escalate alerts in realistic SOC scenarios.

* **Core SOC Solutions** - I got hands‑on with SIEM, EDR, and SOAR to understand the core tools SOC analysts rely on.

* **Cyber Defence Frameworks** - I studied frameworks like Pyramid of Pain, Cyber Kill Chain, and MITRE to better understand adversary behaviour and improve detection and response.

* **Phishing Analysis** - I analysed phishing emails and practised techniques to identify and defend against real‑world phishing attempts.

* **Network Traffic Analysis** - I learned the basics of network traffic analysis and used Wireshark to spot different types of attacks.

* **Network Security Monitoring** - I explored network security fundamentals, monitoring perimeters, and analysing traffic and logs for signs of MITM, discovery, and exfiltration.

* **Web Security Monitoring** - I practised protecting and monitoring web services through SOC‑oriented labs and real‑world scenarios.

* **Windows Security Monitoring** - I learned how Windows logging works and used real examples to detect common Windows attacks.

* **Linux Security Monitoring** - I learned Linux logging and applied hands‑on labs to detect typical Linux attacks.

* **Malware Concepts for SOC** - I identified common malware types, analysed files, and learned why living‑off‑the‑land techniques are increasingly used.

* **Threat Analysis Tools** - I practised using threat intelligence, enrichment techniques, and analysis workflows to strengthen SOC investigations.

* **SIEM Triage for SOC** - I used SIEM to detect early signs of attacks, investigate alerts, and correlate logs to build incident timelines.

* **SOC Level 1 Capstone Challenges** - I investigated critical incidents and applied the full set of SOC L1 skills while handling diverse artefacts

### Tools learned
During the course I was introduced to many new tools (and commands) that were required to complete the challenges.

* **Splunk / ELK** - triage alerts, investigate malicious activity, analyze logs, and spot threats.

* **CyberChef** - decoding, deobfuscation, and quick data transformations.

* **Wireshark** - network traffic capture and analysis.

* **Snort** - write detection rules and operate an IDS/IPS.

* **Linux logs** - analyse logs such as /var/log/auth.log and /var/log/audit.log.

* **Sysmon** - Windows event monitoring (also available for Linux); many event IDs to learn.


* **YaraGen + Loki** - generate YARA signatures and scan systems/logs with Loki.

* **Gobuster** - web directory and virtual host enumeration.

* **whois** - OSINT for domain and registrant information.

* **nmap** - active reconnaissance and host/service enumeration.

* other commands examples:
```shell
netstat, traceroute, ping, arp, nslookup, dig,
sha256sum, md5sum, grep, find, strings,
ps, pstree, top
```
